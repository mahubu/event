# event
A simple event system written in Java 8+.

## Motivation
This is a project about writting an event system with basic features, using lambdas. It should be enhanced (or not?) by finding a neat & clever way to extract event type from its associated event consumer.  

### What should I do with this?
Enhancing it ?
Using it as a starting point for a more advanced event system?
